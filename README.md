Mod that adds an enemy based on Unreal's tentacles. It contains custom animations and AI.

## Behaviour

* Spawns in the interiors of the moons in dispersed packs of 3.
* Once spawned it sticks to a ceiling or floor and shoots any players that get too close.
* Can be stunned when dealt damage.

## ToDo

* Config file.

## Future projects

* More Unreal:
    * Passive creatures like [Nali cows](https://unreal.fandom.com/wiki/Nali_Cow) and [rabbits](https://unreal.fandom.com/wiki/Nali_Rabbit)
    * Hostile creatures like [Skaarj](https://unreal.fandom.com/wiki/Skaarj_Warrior), [Slith](https://unreal.fandom.com/wiki/Slith) and [Brutes](https://unreal.fandom.com/wiki/Brute)
    * Moon (Maybe more than one. Who knows)
    * Scrap
* Original creatures, both hostile and passive.
* Maybe more stuff inspired/based on some of my favourite games, like:
    * Dungeon Siege
    * Grim Dawn
